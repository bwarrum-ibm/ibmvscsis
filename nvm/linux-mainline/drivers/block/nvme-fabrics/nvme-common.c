 * The NVMe Fabrics project separates the NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory express)
 * SSD protocol from the physical technology or 'fabric' (RDMA, ethernet,
 * PCIe, etc) used as the bus communication mechanism between the storage
 * device and the rest of the system. Thus, this initial NVMe framework
 * makes no assumption that a technology like PCIe or RDMA is being
 * used to carry out the protocol.
