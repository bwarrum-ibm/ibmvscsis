Linux NVMe over Fabrics (NVMf) Testcases
========================================

This is a suite of simple tests for the NVMf driver. Note that in some
cases certain programs (e.g. fio) need to be installed. In some cases
a client and server are needed (e.g. rmda).

Running the Testcases
=====================

make run_tests (NB must be run as root)

or

make check (NB must be run as root)

Result Codes
============

	* PASS - The test passed.
	* FAIL - The test failed.

Adding New Testcases
====================

Simply add your test as a bash script and append its name to the
TEST_PROGS variable in Makefile.

To Be Done
==========

Everything except simple loop test :-)
